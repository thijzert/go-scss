go-scss is an experiment in writing a compiler in Go. It compiles SASS/SCSS into CSS.

Building
--------
Simply run:
```
go build -o scss cmd/scss/*.go
```

Usage
-----
To compile a single file, run:
```
./scss FILE.scss
```
This will create FILE.css

Known issues
------------
go-scss currently only supports an embarrassingly tiny subset of SASS/SCSS.
